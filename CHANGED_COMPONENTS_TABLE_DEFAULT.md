# Changed Components Default View Update

## ‚úÖ CHANGE IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY

Updated the BOMCompare component to make **table view** the default for Changed Components instead of cards view.

## üîÑ What Changed:

### Before:
- Changed Components section defaulted to **cards view**
- Users had to manually switch to table view if preferred

### After:
- Changed Components section now defaults to **table view**
- Users can still switch to cards view using the toggle buttons
- More data visible at a glance with the table format

## üìÅ File Modified:

**`src/components/BOMCompare.tsx`**
- Line 16: Changed `useState<"cards" | "table">("cards")` to `useState<"cards" | "table">("table")`

## üí° Benefits of Table View as Default:

1. **More Information Visible**: Table format shows more components at once
2. **Better for Comparison**: Side-by-side old/new values are easier to scan
3. **Compact Display**: Takes up less vertical space
4. **Professional Look**: Table format is more conventional for technical data
5. **Faster Analysis**: Users can quickly scan through multiple changed components

## üéØ User Experience:

- **Default Behavior**: When users navigate to BOM comparison with changed components, they'll see the table view immediately
- **Toggle Available**: Users can still switch to cards view using the toggle buttons if they prefer the detailed card format
- **Consistent Interface**: Toggle buttons work exactly the same, just with a different default
- **Remembered State**: Once a user changes the view mode, their preference is maintained during that session

## üîß Technical Details:

The change was minimal but effective:
- Modified the initial state of `viewMode` from `"cards"` to `"table"`
- All existing toggle functionality remains intact
- Both card and table views are fully functional
- No other components or logic needed updating

The table view provides a more efficient default experience for analyzing changed components while preserving the option to switch to the detailed card view when needed.

---

**Ready for immediate use!** The next time users compare BOM files with changed components, they'll see the table view by default.
