# AI Assistant Fixes - June 13, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Model Selection Problem** ✅
**Issue**: Only llama3.2 appeared and users couldn't select other models
**Root Cause**: Auto-selection logic was too aggressive and would override manual selections
**Fix**:
- Added `hasAutoSelected` state to track whether auto-selection has occurred
- Modified auto-selection to only run once on initial load 
- Added proper dependency array to prevent re-runs that override manual selections
- Auto-selection now only happens if no valid model is currently selected

### 2. **AI Assistant Availability** ✅
**Issue**: AI assistant wasn't prominently available before file upload
**Fix**:
- Added "AI Assistant" tab to main navigation
- Made AI Assistant the default active tab on app load
- Added prominent welcome message explaining capabilities
- Updated tab switching logic to preserve AI Assistant tab when uploading files
- Enhanced welcome message with emojis and clear feature list

### 3. **Undefined Length Property Error** ✅
**Issue**: Error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')"
**Root Cause**: Inadequate handling of undefined arrays in comparison results
**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive array validation using `Array.isArray()` checks
- Protected all array access with proper defensive coding
- Fixed comparison result handling to safely access nested properties
- Enhanced message handling to prevent undefined array errors
