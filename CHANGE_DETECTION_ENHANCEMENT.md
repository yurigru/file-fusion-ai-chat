# Enhanced Change Detection for BOM Analysis

## üéØ Problem Addressed

When users ask about "changed components from old to new", the RAG system was returning individual components from both files rather than actual **component changes**. This update fixes that limitation.

## ‚ùå **Previous Behavior**

**Query**: `"changed components from old to new"`  
**Result**: Individual components from both a_old.xml and a_new.xml
- U43: Same data in both files (NOT a change)
- U44: Same data in both files (NOT a change)
- Average similarity: 51% (poor relevance)

## ‚úÖ **Enhanced Behavior**

### **Improved System Prompt**
The Enhanced BOM Analysis prompt now includes:

```
CHANGE DETECTION QUERIES:
- "changed components" = Look for components that appear in both files but have different values
- "what changed from old to new" = Focus on actual differences, not duplicates
- "component changes" = Suggest using the Compare Files feature for detailed change analysis
- If RAG returns identical components from both files, explain this is NOT a change

RAG LIMITATIONS FOR CHANGES:
- RAG shows individual components, not comparisons
- For detailed change analysis, recommend: "Use the Compare Files feature above"
- Explain when results don't actually show changes
```

### **New Component Changes API**
Added endpoint: `GET /api/rag/component-changes`

**Returns**:
```json
{
  "changes": [
    {
      "refdes": "R1",
      "old": {"part_name": "OLDPART", "part_num": "12345"},
      "new": {"part_name": "NEWPART", "part_num": "67890"}
    }
  ],
  "added": [...],
  "removed": [...],
  "summary": {
    "total_changes": 1,
    "total_added": 5,
    "total_removed": 2
  }
}
```

## üß† **AI Understanding Enhancement**

The AI will now:

1. **Recognize Change Queries**: Understand when users ask about differences between BOMs
2. **Explain RAG Limitations**: When RAG returns duplicates, explain this isn't a change
3. **Recommend Better Tools**: Suggest using the Compare Files feature for detailed analysis
4. **Provide Context**: Explain what constitutes an actual component change

## üß™ **Expected AI Responses**

### **For "changed components from old to new":**

```
Based on the RAG results, I can see components U43 and U44 that appear in both 
the old and new BOMs, but they have identical specifications - these are NOT 
changed components.

For detailed component change analysis, I recommend using the **Compare Files** 
feature above this chat. It will show you:
- Components that changed (same REFDES, different specs)
- Added components (only in new BOM)
- Removed components (only in old BOM)

The RAG system shows individual components but isn't optimized for detecting 
differences between file versions.
```

### **For "show resistors in new bom":**
```
Here are the resistors from the new BOM:
- R89: RES CHIP MF 25.5K (Part: 34759965M)
- R90: RES CHIP MF 1.5K (Part: 34760049M)
- C999: RES CHIP MF 10K (Part: 00005021N)
```

## üéÆ **User Experience**

### **Change Detection Queries** 
**Best Tool**: Compare Files feature  
**RAG Role**: Explain limitations and guide to better tools

### **Component Type Queries**
**Best Tool**: RAG with Enhanced BOM Analysis  
**Expected**: High similarity scores for correct component types

### **Individual Component Lookup**
**Best Tool**: RAG search  
**Expected**: Specific component details and specifications

## üîÑ **Implementation Status**

‚úÖ **Enhanced System Prompt**: Updated with change detection guidance  
‚úÖ **Component Changes API**: `/api/rag/component-changes` endpoint added  
‚úÖ **Frontend Updates**: Enhanced BOM Analysis prompt includes change detection rules  
‚úÖ **Build Tested**: Frontend compiles successfully  
‚úÖ **Backend Tested**: API endpoint responds correctly  

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Test with actual BOM data**: Upload BOMs to verify change detection
2. **Frontend integration**: Add UI for component changes API (optional)
3. **Query refinement**: Monitor how AI handles change-related queries
4. **User feedback**: Adjust prompts based on real usage patterns

The enhanced system should now provide much better guidance when users ask about component changes, directing them to the appropriate tools while explaining the limitations of RAG for comparison tasks.
